    "Publically available data containing movie/tv shows genres, rating, and year of release has already been collected by various reputable sources. We chose to investigate the IMDb Datasets (https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/). These datasets have movie data going back all the way to               . The datasets also contain a wide range of potentially interesting data including: if it's an Adult movie, the production year, other(potentially foriegn) titles , names of directors, names of writers, etc. Another big positive to working with these datasets is that they are completely free to the public.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile with other media datasets, while they are just as extensive as IMDb, they would require a payment to get the complete dataset and not just a sample. For instance, another database we were considering using was The Numbers (https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-records/domestic/all-movies/cumulative/all-time/2501). However, we realised to get the data we required we would have to pay $475. \n"

    "There times when the data you recieve from the databases are not in the correct format. Or, in a format that is difficult for the system to comprehend/handle. \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, one positive to IMDb Datasaets is that we would have a large dataset to analyze and explore. However, it is also a negative. Because it is so large (a total of 710 MB!!), it is impossible for most laptops/computers to process the data all at once. As a result, it must be condensed to only contain data we think may be relavent in future analysis and must be proccessed in chunks. \n",
